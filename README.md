## How's It Made
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript \
Originally, I considered making my portfolio using React. However, I've been looking into web sustainablity and decided to create a static web page to reduce energy consumption. 
Other considerations considered for sustainability:
1. Using System Fonts - They are already installed on a user's device and do not require extra data to be downloaded, which reduces energy consumption and carbon emissions with every page load.
2. Default Dark Mode & Reducing White Space - White backgrounds require significantly more energy to illuminate all pixels compared to dark backgrounds, especially on OLED displays where it can consume up to 47% more power at high brightness. This increased power usage leads to faster battery drain and higher carbon emissions.
3. No Images -
4. Green Host - Using CloudFlare which runs on renewable energy and also helps manage bots

## Lessons Learned
I learned more about web sustainability through this project, and that simple is sometimes much better.
